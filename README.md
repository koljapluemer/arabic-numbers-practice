## About

...this is a little tool I built to practice numbers in Arabic. Check it out [here](https://arabic-numbers.koljapluemer.com/). This project is a little game, repeatedly asking single-choice questions. In the background, it employs a Spaced Repetition system, which you can read about [here](https://koljapluemer.com/2023/09/23/arabic-numbers-sr.html).
